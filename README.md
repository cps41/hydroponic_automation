# Hydroponic Automation
Repository for automating pH and EC levels in a hydroponic system.

# EC Sensor
Electrical conductivity is a good measurement for the ionic content of a water solution. This measurement can translate into a decent guage for the nutrient concentration in a hydroponic solution. Since the ionic concentration of a solution can cause harm to plants growing hydroponically, it is important to constantly monitor it. Improper EC levels can cause nutrient induced defficiency even be toxic and cause chemical burning of a plant.

# PH Sensor
Imbalanced pH levels are also integral to plant growth. While the pH balance of a plant medium is always changing, it is typically bufferede by soil. Without that buffer in a hydroponic system, it is necessary to incorporate a manual, or in our case automatic, buffering system. If the balance is too far ooutside of the optimal growth range, it will cause nutrient availability to decrease and can have detrimental effects on the crops.
