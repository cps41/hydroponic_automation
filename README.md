# Hydroponic Automation
Repository for automating pH and EC levels in a hydroponic system.

# EC Sensor
Electrical conductivity is a good measurement for the ionic content of a water solution. This measurement can translate into a decent guage for the nutrient concentration in a hydroponic solution. Since the ionic concentration of a solution can cause harm to plants growing hydroponically, it is important to constantly monitor it.
- Measured in microSiemens/centimeter
- Low EC levels can cause nutrient induced defficiency
- High EC levels can be toxic and even cause chemical burning of a plant

# PH Sensor
Imbalanced pH levels are also integral to plant growth.
